Miso  is  a  small utility which allows programmers to create menus and
forms for use in interactive scripts. Miso reads a simple  schema  con‚Äê
tained  in  a file and uses the curses library to create a menu or form
as defined by the schema objects.

Miso writes all information obtained from the user to stderr.
